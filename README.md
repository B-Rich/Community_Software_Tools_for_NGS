# Community Software Tools for Next Generation Sequencing
The goal of this repository is to compile a semi-comprehensive list of community software tools that are used to study genetic and genomic variation in next generation sequencing data and work with NCBI resources. 

A user friendly website can be found [here](http://ncbi-hackathons.github.io/Community_Software_Tools_for_NGS/)!  Please note that it is under ongoing development, and suggestions for repositories we may be missing can be made by submitting issues or pull requests.
